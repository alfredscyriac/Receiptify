    1. Monthly Budget: The user's total budget for the month

    - Clear verdict: "On Track", "Warning", or "Over Budget"

    3. CATEGORY BREAKDOWN ANALYSIS
    - Identify top 3 spending categories
    - Highlight any categories with unusually high spending
    - Compare categories against typical spending patterns (if possible)
    - Point out any concerning trends

    4. ACTIONABLE SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES (Most Important Section)

    5. POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT
    - Acknowledge any categories where they spent wisely or stayed under budget
    - Encourage responsible spending behaviors observed in the data

    SAVINGS TIPS GUIDELINES:
    - BAD: "Try to eat out less"

    - BAD: "Reduce transportation costs"
    - GOOD: "Your rideshare expenses totaled $240. Consider using public transit for daily commutes (estimated $90/month) and save rideshares for essential trips only. Potential savings: $150/month."

    - BAD: "Cut unnecessary subscriptions"
    - GOOD: "Review your $89 in entertainment subscriptions. Are you actively using Netflix, Hulu, AND HBO Max? Keeping just 2 services could save $15-20/month."

    FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE IN CLEAN MARKDOWN:
    - Use headers (##) for main sections
    - Use bold (**text**) for emphasis on key numbers
    - Use bullet points for lists
